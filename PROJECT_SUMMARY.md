- Brands have zero visibility into AI recommendations
- No existing tools measure or optimize "LLM-ability"

2. **Prompt Simulation Engine** - Test 20+ common queries to find mention gaps  
3. **Website Audit** - Analyze site for LLM-friendly content/structure
4. **Optimization Engine** - Generate schema, meta tags, FAQ content
5. **Competitor Analysis** - Reverse-engineer why competitors get mentioned more
