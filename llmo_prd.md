## Executive Summary

LLMO (Large Language Model Optimization) is a SaaS platform that helps brands optimize their visibility and recommendation frequency in Large Language Models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity. As AI becomes the primary discovery channel for many users, LLMO provides the equivalent of "SEO for AI" - enabling brands to measure, analyze, and improve their presence in LLM responses.
